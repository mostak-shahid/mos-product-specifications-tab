    When selling products online, it’s important to provide customers with full product details to help them make informed purchase decisions. WooCommerce product specifications are an excellent way to display details in an orderly manner. They give give shoppers all the product insights quickly and with less clutter.

    By providing your customers with detailed product information, you increase their likelihood of purchasing. At the same time, customers are less likely to return the product because they know exactly what they're buying.

    In this article, we’ll first learn why it's important to display product specification data. Then, I'll describe two easy ways to display product specifications in WooCommerce:

    <h2>What is the purpose of WooCommerce product specifications?</h2>
    Simply put, product specifications help display detailed and granular information about a product, such as features and characteristics, beyond what is provided in the basic product fields. The specifications are neatly organized on product pages to help customers quickly find the information they are looking for to make an informed product decision.

    “What is the difference between product fields and product specifications?” is a common question when it comes to this topic. The simple answer is that there isn’t any fundamental difference between the two. They both help in displaying product information to customers; the difference lies in the level of detail they offer.

    You can display broad information about the product, such as the price, category, or colors, using product fields or custom fields. But if you want to display granular information about the product, such as product dimensions, item weight, warranty, or the product manufacturer, using product specifications can be a great alternative. By adding even minor details, you can help your customers make a more informed purchase decision and reduce the likelihood of returns and increase customer satisfaction.

    A good structured product specifications table can also help you with the search rankings of your product page by improving SEO and thus giving you a competitive edge over your competitors.

    <h2>What types of products need detailed specifications?</h2>

    Before we learn how to add WooCommerce product specifications to your website, let’s check some of the use cases where adding product specifications can be useful to the business.

    Sometimes having good product images isn't nearly enough! Providing WooCommerce product specification data is helpful for any product where customers want to know detailed information before deciding whether to buy.
    
    
    

    Here are some good use-case examples.

    <h3>Electronic products</h3>

    Every electronic product has multiple technical features that customers need to know before they can make a purchase decision. For example, if we consider a TV, it is important for customers to know its various aspects, such as the screen size, connectivity, resolution, apps, and product dimensions. The same applies to any other electronics product, such as mobile phones.

    Cramming all this data into a product description makes it difficult to read and clutters up the product page. Instead, you can display it in a more structured way in a dedicated specifications tab on the product page, or give the option for customers to download the specifications.

    <h3>Industrial products</h3>

    Usually, industrial products are quite technical and complex and require multiple reviews of the specifications of the products before one can place an order. For this use case, adding a downloadable specifications list can help the purchase process.

    For larger industrial orders, new products are usually reviewed by multiple departments of the company before they actually place the order. Giving customers access to a downloadable specs sheet or a specifications document can speed up the purchase process.

    <h3>Construction and DIY products</h3>

    When it comes to construction, almost every product has a few unique specifications that set it apart from other variations of the product, such as nails of different sizes and different paint bases or lumbar. Customers purchasing such products often need to know the specifications, such as the coverage area, durability, and warranty.

    Providing a downloadable specifications document that contains this information can help customers understand if the product will meet their needs and if it is suitable for the project they're working on.

    <h3>Apparel products</h3>

    Most clothing products have some aspects that a user usually checks before placing an order. These aspects can be size, color, material, country of origin, design, or even occasion.

    Adding these details on the products page can help your customers in placing the order and reduce product return/refund rates as the users can check these details before placing the order. Displaying these specifications in a table can be a great addition to your product page.

    <h3>Digital products</h3>

    Digital products such as apps, extensions, add-ons or plugins often have multiple specifications attributed to them. Attributes such as total downloads/active installs, version number, last release date, and product feature sets are crucial in almost every digital product.

    Most customers prefer checking these details before making a purchase decision, and simply displaying the specifications in a table can be a good addition to your product page. You can also add the details as a downloadable file if you think your customers will require a copy of the details of the products offline as well.
    
    <h3>Medical and laboratory products</h3>
    
    Due to their nature, medical and lab products such as chemicals or equipment can carry multiple attributes with them that needs to be checked prior to ordering. Even a single order of a chemical needs reviewing of factors such as size, molecular weight, test results, source, manufacturer, or license grade requirements for ordering the products. For this, adding a downloadable specs doc on the product page can help the customers and their teams authorize the purchase orders.

Simply displaying product specifications in a table and adding them as a downloadable file are both good alternatives, depending on the nature of the products. In this tutorial, we’ll checkout both methods in detail. Let’s jump into it!
